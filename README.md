This is my Program of Programs. I am setting up a way to go through my projects and some lessons that would allow the user to interact and understand the programs, algorithms and lessons. 

Sorting Algorithms Overview
    tell user what we are going to do
    request 10 integers under 100
    store those integers in an array
    Ask the user to pick an algorithm to go over
    *Using the numbers they gave in the array, go through the steps in sorting the array. 
    Ask user if they want to go over another array
    repeat *
    if they say no, exit to main program.
