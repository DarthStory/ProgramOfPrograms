This is my Program of Programs. I am setting up a way to go through my projects and some lessons that would allow the user to interact and understand the programs, algorithms and lessons. 

Sorting Algorithms Overview
    1. tell user what we are going to do
    2. request 10 integers under 100
    3. store those integers in an array
    4. Ask the user to pick an algorithm to go over
    5. *Using the numbers they gave in the array, go through the steps in sorting the array. 
    6. Ask user if they want to go over another array
    7. repeat *
    8. if they say no, exit to main program.
